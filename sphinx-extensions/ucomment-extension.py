    TODO(KGD): issue # 1

    Django has a slightly different approach to Sphinx when it comes to static
    media and files. http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/

    Django
    ------
    * Put files in a 'static' directory under the application, or somewhere
      referenced by ``STATICFILES_DIRS``.
    * Run the script: ``./manage.py collectstatic`` to move these files to
      ``STATICFILES_ROOT``.
    * Reference these files using Django's templating system.

    Sphinx
    ------
    * Put the files under your document root somewhere, e.g. images/abc.png
    * Refer to the images relative to your top source directory.
    * Sphinx copies all media files over to _images in the output
      directory and a hard-coded, relative link is placed in the HTML.
      e.g. ../_images/abc.png
    * However, the key point is that all media files, no matter where they are
      in the document hierarchy, are placed in a SINGLE directory, ``_images``.

    How to combine these 2 approaches?
    ----------------------------------
    * Follow the Sphinx approach, but strip out all relative links to images,
      and replace them with a hard-coded, direct link in the HTML.

      For example, Sphinx will write
      <img src="../../abc.png">      and
      <img src="../def.png">

      We will change it to:
      <img src="{{IMAGE_LOCATION}}/abc.png">     and
      <img src="{{IMAGE_LOCATION}}/def.png">

    * Then {{IMAGE_LOCATION}} will be replaced with a fully qualified URL,
      set in the conf/settings.py file: ``media_url`` and ``media_root``
